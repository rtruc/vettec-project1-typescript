# [Portfolio Website](https://rtruc.github.io/vettec-project1-typescript/gallery.html)
Website developed using HTML5, CSS3, Typescript, Webpack and a whole lot of Lorem Ipsum. Features dynamically generated HTML elements along with an image gallery that includes a fluid zoom and backing shadowbox for optimal photo presentation.
- Gallery built in Typescript and uses a JSON payload for initialization. ([Source](https://github.com/rtruc/vettec-project1-typescript/tree/main/ts/sub/gallery)) ([Hosted Example](https://rtruc.github.io/vettec-project1-typescript/gallery.html))
- [Navigation controls](https://github.com/rtruc/vettec-project1-typescript/blob/main/ts/sub/navbar.ts) and [footers](https://github.com/rtruc/vettec-project1-typescript/blob/main/ts/sub/footer.ts) are dynamically generated HTML elements built using Typescript. 
- Includes a custom [Webpack](https://github.com/rtruc/vettec-project1-typescript/blob/main/webpack.config.js) build environment to enable development as a multi-file Typescript project.
- Styled using CSS3 and modern flex boxes.
- Utilized Git and GitHub for version control.
